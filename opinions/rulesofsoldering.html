<h3><strong>RULES OF SOLDERING*</strong></h3><br><br>
<ul>
<li>A fume hood is not mandatory, this ain't a science lab, just don't be stupid, don't inhale the fumes. (desk fans!)</li><br>
<li>Wear glasses of some kind to prevent the eyes getting crispy. If you can't afford a pair of sunglasses, but you can afford a soldering station, then you might wanna adjust your priorites. Anyways, if you don't have safety glasses, some alternatives are the Safety Squints, or the Safety Dance.</li><br>
<li>Try and keep things from setting on fire, and solder away from the smoke alarm, if you don't have a fan.</li><br>
<li>Wash your hands, dumbass. Lead poisoning isn't good.</li><br>
<li>Spongey sponges are your friend!</li><br>
</ul>
