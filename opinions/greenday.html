<h2><b> Green Day is my favorite band </b></h2><h6>if you tell me it sucks, I will slam you through 3 walls</h6><br>

After a somewhat random turn of events, including me hearing Basket Case (off Dookie) on the radio, and me hearing Wake Me Up When September Ends (off American Idiot), I found out about more of Green Day's stuff.
<br>I happened to really like the band, and over time, I listened to them more and more, and now here we are, basically all I listen to now is Green Day! My favorite song is probably either Holiday or The Grouch, from American Idiot and Nimrod, respectively.
