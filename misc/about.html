<h3><b> About Me </b></h3>
<br><br>
I go by Killaship on the internet. I'm a programmer from the Eastern US of A. The exact state is left as an exercise for the reader. <br>
I got my start on the interwebs by fooling around with Scratch when I was younger, as well as similar edutainment school activities. <br>
Later, I did my business on an old Chromebook, on which I learned Python, began playing the game torn.space, which is how I got my name, and began my presence on the web. <br>
I then got an older, hand-me-down PC. On this, I got interested in Arduino, and learned C. From there, I got interested in more advanced Python projects, and later, OS dev. <br>
I grew my Arduino collection, aquired a few single board computers, and got better at programming, and eventually, here we are.
<br> In case you couldn't tell, this all took place over about 6 years.
<br>
Anyways, I also like to write short stories about sci-fi stuff, but all of them are unfinished, maybe one or two friends have read them, and they're old and cringey. <br>
I really like the band Green Day, and I'm fond of most other rock music as well, so there's that if you wanna know my music tastes.<br>
