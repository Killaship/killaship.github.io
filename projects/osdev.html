<b><h3> Operating System Development <h3><b>
<p> I work on a hobby operating system. I have 3 major projects at this point, called Codename Spectrum, YAOS, and Codename Proton.
<br><br> Spectrum was my first kernel, based heavily off an online tutorial. I didn't do much with it, but it ended up with a small shell and a selection of commands.
<br><br> YAOS is a redo, standing for Yet Another OS. It doesn't have a shell or anything, it functions much more on kernel capabilities than on the user. 
<br> In fact, it doesn't give any user interface, but it did finish implementing interrupts, and has timer functionality.
<br><br> Finally, Proton was an attempt at creating something similar to DOS, but it never quite worked out, due to the difficulties of writing pure assembly.
