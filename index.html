    <p> Hello, and welcome to this website I originally threw together sometime in 2020!
        I've moved from Replit to Github Pages for hosting this, so that's cool. (check websiteidk.killaship.repl.co for the original)
        Anyways, I'm your basic everyday computer nerd. I like programming Arduinos, in C, homebrew OSes, shells, and other things like that.
        (You'd probably find that out once you checked my Github profile.) 
 </p>

      I made the jump to Github Pages. The Replit half of the website didn't make it... (Planning for a whole new redo of the website.)
      Anyways, I've just continued on with OSdev for the past month, stared out the window and saw that not much snow snew, and I got a neat little SoC called the Atomic Pi.
      I seriously hope that the enter's I'm typing right now turn into line breaks, btw.
      Also, go sit on a chair, it feels nice.

      So, a lot of things happened since I last updated this sometime in January 2021. I got a PC, I got into Linux, I code in C now, and do more advanced projects, like hobby operating systems, Arduino things, and Linux things. I'll try to update this more, but thanks for being here I guess.
